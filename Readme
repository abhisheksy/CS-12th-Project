This was my project in 12th standard.
Just found it somewhere in my PC, so thought of sharing.

It is a normal telephone billing program.
No, it doesnt moniter any calls, you have to give input of how much data or calls have you used. It will analyse and store the results in a file.

Hahahaha..... For that time, I used to feel good that i made this project....
